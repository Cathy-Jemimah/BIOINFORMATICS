In this repository you will find how two proteins namely, P1 and P40/P90 of Mycoplasma Pnuemoniae are studied for their potential binding sites on the respective proteins.
The potential challenges and limitations of targeting P1 and P40/P90 proteins for Mycoplasma pneumoniae treatment were further studied.
And the significance of this study was also investigated for further drug discovery.
